# E L E V A T E - OS X Auto Configuration

![](docs/assets/iterm.png)

Install apps, manage dotfiles and set default app and system configurations with a single command. Elevate can be used to quicky provision a developer machine or pimp out an existing bland environment. Just run $elevate -a and begin impressing your friend(s).

So what does it do exactly? Elevate harnesses great tools like Bundler, cURL, Gem, Go, Hombrew, Homebrew Cask, npm, pip and wget to provision all the tools you need for most development environments. Next, it creates opinionated .dotfiles for the tools you install as well as predefined preferences and plugins to give you the most an app can offer. Finally, it processes a set of OS X system defaults to provide a more powerful environment for developer workflows.

Don't hesitate. You know you want to elevate.

# Installation


## 1. Download the script and unpack it 

[https://github.com/mackdoyle/osx-auto-config/archive/master.zip]()

*(Alternatively, if you already have Git installed, you can clone the repo: [git clone  git@github.com:mackdoyle/osx-auto-config.git ~/Downloads]())*

## 2. Launch Terminal and change into the project's root folder

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/elevate
```

## 3. Run the script

This script supports multiple installation options:

```bash
-a Provisions OS X with an opinionated selection of apps. For example, it will install node-sass instead of sass, etc.
-f <FILE> Pass a file that contains a line delimited list of apps to install and configure.
-l <LIST> Pass a space delimited list, in quotes, of apps to install and configure.
-s Show all supported applications.
-h Show help.
```
To run the default, and install an opinionated selection of apps, execute the following command from within the `elevate` directory.

```bash
./elevate.sh -a
```

*NOTE: If you receive a permission error when executing the script, elevate the permissions using:*

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 *
```

# Selectively Installing and Configuring
To maintain finer control over apps and binaries, you can pass a file that contains only the items you want installed.

## 1. Run `./elevate.sh -s` to get a list of all supported apps.

## 2. Copy the list and paste it into a file

## 4. Run `./elevte.sh -f ~/Desktop/my_file` passing your newly saved file using the `-f` option.
