## OS X Auto Config (To be Named)
Naming Ideas:
- Gratify
- Voracious.ly 
- Mac Attire
- Getup

WARNING: This project is still in the initial development phase. Many recipes are just place holders at this point.  I do welcome comments on its direction, however.

OS X Auto Config provisions a Mac with all the tools needed for the modern programmer. With a single command you can configure a new machine or have it add great tools you may be missing.

## Get Started
1. Clone this repository or grab the zip
2. Run ignition.sh from anywhere

````
[path_to_ignition]/ignition.sh 
````

ignition.sh invokes recipes for various programs and services. You can comment out recipes you do not want installed by prpending the line with a hash (#).
